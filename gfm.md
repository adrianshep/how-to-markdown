# How To Markdown  

 ## GFM (Exercise 12 of 12)  

  If you are a developer, then you have heard about GitHub. GitHub is an  
  important part of the community. Why are we talking about it? That's  
  because GitHub is a big customer of Markdown. Even more, GitHub uses its  
  own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of  
  useful features. This version of markdown is called GitHub Flavored  
  Markdown or simply GFM.  

  From previous exercises you are already familiar with syntax highlighting  
  in blocks of code and tables. However, there are some other features which  
  may be helpful for you.  

 ### Task lists  

  To create a task list you should create an ordered or unordered list. Then  
  you can use squared brackets that will be turned into checkboxes. An x  
  between them makes the item marked as completed. Example:  

     - [x] [links](#), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported  
     - [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)  
     - [x] this is a complete item  
     - [ ] this is an incomplete item  

   » [x] [links](#), formatting, and <del>tags</del> supported                   
   » [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)          
   » [x] this is a complete item                                                 
   » [ ] this is an incomplete item                                              

 ### SHA references  

  Any reference to a commit’s SHA-1 hash will be automatically converted  
  into a link to that commit on GitHub:  

     4ad0c921206dec4d1518f4aeead932e7617f934f  
     denysdovhan/how-to-markdowkn@4ad0c921206dec4d1518f4aeead932e7617f934f  

 ### Issue and Pull request references  

  Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically  
  converted into a link:  

     #1  
     denysdovhan/how-to-markdowkn#1  

 ### Username @mentions  

  Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to  
  come and view the comment. This is called a @mention, because you’re  
  mentioning the individual. You can also mention @teams within an  
  organization.  

 ### Emoji  

  It's a funny part, but it's still important. GFM also supports emoji!  

  ✨ 🐫 💥  

  To see a list of every emoji that is supported, check out the [Emoji Cheat  
  Sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/).  

 ## THE CHALLENGE  

  Add a first-level heading that contains GFM.  

  Please create a to-do list with these tasks:  

   » hey                                                                         
   » ho                                                                          
   » let's go                                                                    

  Then mark item ho as completed.

  Here's the official solution in case you want to compare notes:

```plain

# GFM

 » [ ] hey                                                                   
 » [x] ho                                                                    
 » [ ] let's go                                                              

```

# Congratulations!

You finished this workshopper! Now you are familiar with Markdown and know
how to write and read Markdown documents.

What should you do next? Just write some Markdown. Rewrite the README-file
of your project in Markdown, start to write posts in your blog in
Markdown, whatever.

Anyway, knowledge of Markdown is a very nice skill that will be useful.
