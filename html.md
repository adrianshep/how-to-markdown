# How To Markdown  

## HTML (Exercise 11 of 12)  

 If you want to style something more than is allowed in Markdown, you can  
 use raw HTML in your Markdown and it'll work pretty well.  

    <p align="center">Centered text works well!</p>  

 And you will get a centered paragraph.  

 Sometimes it's helpful, but be careful! Markdown inside HTML won't be  
 rendered! That means if you write something like this:  

    <span>Markdown **won't** work here!</span>  

 It won't work.  

## THE CHALLENGE  

 Add HTML as the first-level heading.  

 Below, use HTML for centering this text:

    # Works!

     You can use HTML for creating anything you want: definition lists,
     embedding posts from social networks, embedding videos from YouTube, etc.
     Just type HTML tags right in your Markdown document and see how it works.
