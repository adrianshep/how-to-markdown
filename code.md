# How To Markdown  

Here's the official solution in case you want to compare notes:


    # Code

    ```js
    const add = (a, b) => a + b;

 ```

# Awesome!

 Now you can embed code snippets into Markdown documents. That is yet
 another thing that is used almost everywhere.

 ## CODE (Exercise 8 of 12)  

  Code is a part of Markdown spec. There are two ways to add code in your  
  document: inline code and blocks of code.  

 ### Inline code  

  To mark a part of text as code, just wrap it in back-ticks ( ` ). Here is  
  an example:  

     Inline code transforms into `<code>` html-tag.  

  |> Inline code transforms into <code> html-tag.  

 ### Blocks of code  

  Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ( ``` ),  
  or are indented with four spaces.  

  Syntax highlighting isn't part Markdown's spec. However, many renderers  
  support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those  
  language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer.  

     ```js  
     console.log('This is JavaScript syntax highlighting!');  
     ```  

     ```  
     No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.  
     ```  

         Block of code with indentation.  

  These two blocks will be rendered like so:  

     console.log('This is JavaScript syntax highlighting!');  

     No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.  

     Block of code with indentation.  

  We recommend to use the fenced code blocks instead of blocks with  
  indentation, because they support syntax highlighting.  

 ## THE CHALLENGE  

  Add  Code as the first-level heading in your file.  

  Add this JavaScript code with relevant syntax highlighting:  

     const add = (a, b) => a + b;
